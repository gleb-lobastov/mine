# About

This project is like a blog. But blog of guy who is programmer by profession. So it have quite low-level management.

Second purpose of this project is to have fun with web-technologies and programming approaches.

My favorite rule to check the clock, that explicit is better than implicit. One consequence of it, that project should be well documented. In docs, in commit annotations, everywhere where it reasonable.

And as it personal project I decide to limit myself in the features, but not the way to achieve them

# Documentation

My guess, that all documentation should be reachable from the root, gradually revealing from general to specific implementation details. Navigation through hyperlinks is sufficient for that purpose.

To every new person in team have point to start. And despite this is not team project. I'm trying to implement and test all my ideas.

If you interesting, continue to read about technical information: [project structure and principles](./src/readme.md)
