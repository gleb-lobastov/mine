# About

This is my lovely react sandbox. Just for fun with web-technologies and programming approaches.

To fill it with some meaning, I had to compose some content. Try to fill it with entertaining things. But not always at my best ¯ \ _ (ツ) _ / ¯

And as it personal project I decide to limit myself in the features, but not the way to achieve them

# Documentation

My guess, that all documentation should be reachable from the root, gradually revealing from general to specific implementation details. Navigation through hyperlinks is sufficient for that purpose.

To every new person in team have point to start. And despite this is not team project. I'm trying to implement and test all my ideas.

If you interesting, continue to read about technical information: [project structure and principles](./src/README.md)

# CI

Run "npm run release" when ready to publish next app version to gitPages
